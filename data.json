After two very long weeks, I'm back for another AMA. If you didn't see my last, I look after critically ill COVID patients in a UK centre. The last time we talked, there were around 20 patients admitted to critical care for COVID nationally. A week after that post, that number was over 200 confirmed (with at least as many suspected cases) across the country. In London, the number has been doubling every few days.\n\nI have a couple of days off, and I'm here to take questions on the current situation, the UK government response, or anything else you might want to talk about.\n\nLike before, I'm remaining anonymous as this allows me to answer questions freely and without association to my employer (and I'm also not keen on publicity or extra attention or getting in trouble with my hospital's media department).\n\nThanks, I look forwards to your questions.\n\nEDIT: GMT 1700.

It is heartbreaking to see comments here saying how we deserve it. \n\nYes. Some people are disgusting and uneducated, they eat everything that moves and have total disregard for health\/safety regulations. But most people aren\u2019t like that. Most of us are just normal folks living a normal life. We are just as angry at those exotic animal traders as you are, if not more. \n\nIt\u2019s CNY, and in case you\u2019re not familiar with the Chinese culture, let me first put into perspective it\u2019s importance. It\u2019s like thanksgiving and Christmas combined. Historical\/Traditional significance aside, for millions of people, CNY is the only time of the year where families get to reunite and have a home cooked meal together. It is more common than not for chinese people in more rural areas to go to cities to find better work opportunities. They work hard for the whole year, sending home the little money they earn to support their children and parents. Families don\u2019t get to see each other for a whole year and reunion dinner on CNY eve is something everyone looks forward to. \n\nThe coronavirus is taking away the only time of the year that families get to reunite. Doctors and nurses are working around the clock, many of them have not gone home in weeks; healthcare professionals across China are flying voluntarily to Wuhan to help; factory workers have resumed work due to the shortage of masks and protective suits; 3M and other companies are donating masks too; hotels across Wuhan have offered free accomodation to healthcare professionals whose home are too far away; chain convenient stores are providing free hot meals to hospitals and workers; delivery man have to give up their holidays to deliver food to families because we can\u2019t leave our homes; construction workers are working around the clock to build new hospitals... do all these people working tireless to save lives deserve to get affected and die too??? Those selfish exotic animal traders have taken away precious family time from all these people who are literally putting their lives in danger to help others, and yet on the Internet, these unsung heroes are being lumped together with them, criticised condemned and humiliated. It\u2019s really heartbreaking. Those people don\u2019t deserve any of it. \n\nAs of now, most of our fridges are still fully stocked from CNY, but what about in a week or even a couple of days when we run out of food? My parents just came back from the supermarket and many shelves are empty. Public transport have shut down completely, from today onwards vehicles unrelated to the containment of coronavirus will not be allowed on roads too, no one is allowed to leave Wuhan. So let me ask you, do all of us deserve this too? Especially during a time of supposed celebration. I\u2019m not even a permanent resident here, I am just home for the holidays after being away for more than a year. But now I can\u2019t leave to go back to Uni. I\u2019m sure there are many people in similar situations as me. I hope I\u2019m not coming off as playing the victim. I\u2019m merely trying to tell my side of the story. And I\u2019m so sorry the virus has now spread to other countries. I truly am very sorry. But not all Chinese are bad people. Not all are selfish and entitled and just downright disgusting human beings. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for you to say that we all \u201cdeserve\u201d it because of the terrible behaviours of some.","score":10983,"ups":10983,"downs":0,"permalink":"\/r\/Coronavirus\/comments\/eu8lrl\/currently_in_wuhan_hopefully_im_offering_a_fresh\/","created":"2020-01-26T19:11:52.000Z","numComm":823,"topLevelComments":[]},"fknly7":{"title":"103-year-old Iran woman survives coronavirus: report","url":"https:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/103-old-iran-woman-survives-coronavirus-report-102216586.html","selftext":"","score":10978,"ups":10978,"downs":0,"permalink":"\/r\/Coronavirus\/comments\/fknly7\/103yearold_iran_woman_survives_coronavirus_report\/","created":"2020-03-18T14:47:28.000Z","numComm":300,"topLevelComments":[]},"fisjzn":{"title":"Italy had 3 confirmed cases 3 weeks ago and now has north of 20,000","url":"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2020\/3\/10\/21171217\/coronavirus-covid-19-italy-hospitals","selftext":"","score":10959,"ups":10959,"downs":0,"permalink":"\/r\/Coronavirus\/comments\/fisjzn\/italy_had_3_confirmed_cases_3_weeks_ago_and_now\/","created":"2020-03-15T04:24:34.000Z","numComm":1046,"topLevelComments":[]},"fiqueo":{"title":"Wuhan doctors celebrate closure of last temporary hospital after dramatic fall in cases in China -- Health chiefs say only 11 new cases recorded on one day as tally falls","url":"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/world\/asia\/coronavirus-wuhan-masks-video-doctors-nurses-hospital-a9402631.html","selftext":"","score":10928,"ups":10928,"downs":0,"permalink":"\/r\/Coronavirus\/comments\/fiqueo\/wuhan_doctors_celebrate_closure_of_last_temporary\/","created":"2020-03-15T02:29:18.000Z","numComm":289,"topLevelComments":[]},"fnuv1h":{"title":"Gov.

Given the precipitous worldwide explosion of cases, state and national emergency proclamations, and general clinical belief that things will get much worse before they become better, I hope you will consider putting your computing resources toward this task.\n\nHere are some initial comments on how [Rosetta@home](https:\/\/www.ipd.uw.edu\/2020\/02\/rosettas-role-in-fighting-coronavirus\/) and [Folding@home](https:\/\/foldingathome.org\/2020\/02\/27\/foldinghome-takes-up-the-fight-against-covid-19-2019-ncov\/) are helping to understand and combat SARS-CoV-2.\n\nDistributed computing is a simple concept - an institution takes a large chunk of data and breaks it up into small pieces. The data is sent to participating computers.  Your computer does the number crunching and the finished product is sent back to be added to the whole body of research. The programs can run invisibly in the background, whenever you're not using the computer, or full time. The installation takes up a small amount of space, and you can easily control how much of your computer processing power you want dedicated to either program.\n\nMost of us may not be scientists, virologists, epidemiologists or researchers but that doesn\u2019t mean we are helpless or unable to contribute. Much can be done if we work together as a team, a country, and an international community.\n\nTo download folding@home and join the reddit team:\n\n~Visit this [link.](https:\/\/foldingathome.org\/start-folding\/) to download the FAH client\n\n~Open the FAHControl\n\n~Click \u201cconfigure\u201d\n\n~Select the \u201cIdentity\u201d tab\n\n~Input **236269** under \u201cteam number\u201d\n\n\nTo download rosetta@home and join the Reddit team: \n\n~Visit this [link.](https:\/\/boinc.berkeley.edu)\n\n~Open the BOINC client\n\n~Select \u201ctools\u201d in the menu bar\n\n~Select \u201cadd task\u201d and choose from the scrolling menu \u201crosetta\u201d.\n\n~Go to [this](https:\/\/boinc.bakerlab.org\/rosetta\/team.php) link, search for \"\/r\/covid19\" and join the team.

Please see [this](https:\/\/twitter.com\/drGregBowman\/status\/1239629911310192640?s=20) just released Twitter post for a 3D model of the SARS-CoV-2 \"spike protein\" thanks to Folding@Home!\n\n**EDIT 2:** Many people are saying that they cannot get Folding@Home work units...it seems as if the massive outpouring of help has overwhelmed the current number of work units available.  Dr. Greg Bowman, one of the managers of Folding@Home, has stated that him and his team are working \"around the clock\" to get more work units available (they have a ton of data to process!)\n\n**EDIT 3:** **PLEASE READ!**  I have just spoken to Dr. David Baker, the head of Baker Labs and Rosetta at University of Washington.

I am pleased to have language translation support today from student scientists Ms. Chaerin Yim and Ms. Yunha Jo. \n\nIn COVID-19, humanity now faces a common enemy.

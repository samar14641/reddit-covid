The Gates Foundation has committed up to $100 million to help with the COVID-19 response around the world, as well as $5 million to support our home state of Washington.

I’m joined remotely today by [Dr. Trevor Mundel](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/General-Information/Leadership/Executive-Leadership-Team/Trevor-Mundel), who leads the Gates Foundation’s global health work, and [Dr. Niranjan Bose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niranjan-bose-014b00/), my chief scientific adviser.

Ask us anything about COVID-19 specifically or epidemics and pandemics more generally.

After two very long weeks, I'm back for another AMA. If you didn't see my last, I look after critically ill COVID patients in a UK centre. The last time we talked, there were around 20 patients admitted to critical care for COVID nationally. A week after that post, that number was over 200 confirmed (with at least as many suspected cases) across the country. In London, the number has been doubling every few days.

I have a couple of days off, and I'm here to take questions on the current situation, the UK government response, or anything else you might want to talk about.

Like before, I'm remaining anonymous as this allows me to answer questions freely and without association to my employer (and I'm also not keen on publicity or extra attention or getting in trouble with my hospital's media department).

Thanks, I look forwards to your questions.

EDIT: GMT 1700. Thanks for the discussion. Sorry about the controversy - I realise my statement was provocative and slightly emotional - I've removed some provocative but irrelevant parts. I hasten to stress that I am apolitical. I'll be back to answer a few more later.

eu8lrl,Currently in Wuhan. Hopefully I’m offering a fresh perspective different from what you’re getting from the news,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/eu8lrl/currently_in_wuhan_hopefully_im_offering_a_fresh/,"I’m one of the millions in Wuhan right now who is affected by this. It is heartbreaking to see comments here saying how we deserve it. 

Yes. Some people are disgusting and uneducated, they eat everything that moves and have total disregard for health/safety regulations. But most people aren’t like that. Most of us are just normal folks living a normal life. We are just as angry at those exotic animal traders as you are, if not more. 

It’s CNY, and in case you’re not familiar with the Chinese culture, let me first put into perspective it’s importance. It’s like thanksgiving and Christmas combined. Historical/Traditional significance aside, for millions of people, CNY is the only time of the year where families get to reunite and have a home cooked meal together. It is more common than not for chinese people in more rural areas to go to cities to find better work opportunities. They work hard for the whole year, sending home the little money they earn to support their children and parents. Families don’t get to see each other for a whole year and reunion dinner on CNY eve is something everyone looks forward to. 

The coronavirus is taking away the only time of the year that families get to reunite. Doctors and nurses are working around the clock, many of them have not gone home in weeks; healthcare professionals across China are flying voluntarily to Wuhan to help; factory workers have resumed work due to the shortage of masks and protective suits; 3M and other companies are donating masks too; hotels across Wuhan have offered free accomodation to healthcare professionals whose home are too far away; chain convenient stores are providing free hot meals to hospitals and workers; delivery man have to give up their holidays to deliver food to families because we can’t leave our homes; construction workers are working around the clock to build new hospitals... do all these people working tireless to save lives deserve to get affected and die too??? Those selfish exotic animal traders have taken away precious family time from all these people who are literally putting their lives in danger to help others, and yet on the Internet, these unsung heroes are being lumped together with them, criticised condemned and humiliated. It’s really heartbreaking. Those people don’t deserve any of it. 

As of now, most of our fridges are still fully stocked from CNY, but what about in a week or even a couple of days when we run out of food? My parents just came back from the supermarket and many shelves are empty. Public transport have shut down completely, from today onwards vehicles unrelated to the containment of coronavirus will not be allowed on roads too, no one is allowed to leave Wuhan. So let me ask you, do all of us deserve this too? Especially during a time of supposed celebration. I’m not even a permanent resident here, I am just home for the holidays after being away for more than a year. But now I can’t leave to go back to Uni.

I'm here to take questions on the state of play in the UK, the role of critical care, or anything in general related to the outbreak.

(I've chosen to remain anonymous on this occasion. Our NHS employers see employees as representatives of the hospital 'brand': in this instance I want to answer questions freely and without association.)

I look forward to your questions!

20:30 GMT EDIT: I think I will call this a day - it was really good talking and hearing opinions on the outbreak. Thank you for all the good wishes, they will be passed on.

fjqk2r,“Help with the fight against SARS-CoV-2 from home: donate your computer’s background CPU & GPU time to researchers and clinicians using Rosetta@Home & Folding@Home”,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fjqk2r/help_with_the_fight_against_sarscov2_from_home/,"**(PLEASE READ EDIT 3 BELOW!)**

Hello all.

I want to inform you of the work distributed computing is doing researching SARS-CoV-2.  Given the precipitous worldwide explosion of cases, state and national emergency proclamations, and general clinical belief that things will get much worse before they become better, I hope you will consider putting your computing resources toward this task.

Here are some initial comments on how [Rosetta@home](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/2020/02/rosettas-role-in-fighting-coronavirus/) and [Folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/2020/02/27/foldinghome-takes-up-the-fight-against-covid-19-2019-ncov/) are helping to understand and combat SARS-CoV-2.

Distributed computing is a simple concept - an institution takes a large chunk of data and breaks it up into small pieces. The data is sent to participating computers.  Your computer does the number crunching and the finished product is sent back to be added to the whole body of research. The programs can run invisibly in the background, whenever you're not using the computer, or full time. The installation takes up a small amount of space, and you can easily control how much of your computer processing power you want dedicated to either program.

Most of us may not be scientists, virologists, epidemiologists or researchers but that doesn’t mean we are helpless or unable to contribute. Much can be done if we work together as a team, a country, and an international community.

**EDIT:** Exciting news!  Please see [this](https://twitter.com/drGregBowman/status/1239629911310192640?s=20) just released Twitter post for a 3D model of the SARS-CoV-2 ""spike protein"" thanks to Folding@Home!

**EDIT 2:** Many people are saying that they cannot get Folding@Home work units...it seems as if the massive outpouring of help has overwhelmed the current number of work units available.  Dr. Greg Bowman, one of the managers of Folding@Home, has stated that him and his team are working ""around the clock"" to get more work units available (they have a ton of data to process!)

**EDIT 3:** **PLEASE READ!**  I have just spoken to Dr. David Baker, the head of Baker Labs and Rosetta at University of Washington.  Him and his team are planning a large scale rollout of new SARS-CoV-2 specific work units in short order.

This disease is a serious challange, but for the love of all that is holy please stop acting like this is a 100% lethality disease that diffuses through concrete walls and will reinfect you multiple times until everyone is dead. If you follow BASIC HYGENE INSTRUCTIONS (like you should do anyway in flu season), avoid people who are showing syptoms of sickness and wash your hands often (DON’T FORGET TO CLEAN YOUR PHONE TOO), it is highly unlikely that you will get infected at all. If you have older relatives/friends that you worry about, tell them to stay at home for a while until this blows over.

AMA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fo4pj4/im_joong_sik_eom_md_a_physician_treating_covid19/,"[*Annyeonghaseyo,*](https://youtu.be/w9-xtdwUGS8?t=10) I’m Dr. Joong Sik Eom, infectious diseases physician and professor at the [Gacheon University College of Medicine](http://medicine.gachon.ac.kr) in Incheon, South Korea. I also serve as a member of the national “COVID-19 Response Academic Advisory Council” that advises the South Korean government’s ongoing rapid-response efforts. The idea for the [drive-through testing sites](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX3-KXWmzzs) came from our group.

At the [Gil Medical Center](https://www.gilhospital.com/) where I practice, we are treating severe COVID-19 cases. I have a few patients under my direct care in their 70s to 90s and recently sent someone home after a full recovery.  

Starting at 10am EST, I’ll do my best to answer your questions about COVID-19 in Korea, perhaps on: the public-private response, the healthcare burden, testing coordination, technology, public messaging, medical treatments, cultural factors, facemasks, and the road ahead. I am pleased to have language translation support today from student scientists Ms. Chaerin Yim and Ms. Yunha Jo. 

In COVID-19, humanity now faces a common enemy. We will defeat it faster if we can work together as global citizens, reaching across boundaries to offer knowledge and support. My hope is that our experience here in Korea could be somehow useful to you all. AMA.

EDIT: It's now 1am and I've got to call it a night and get some sleep. Thank you so much for your great questions and interest. I wish all of you great health! [*Gamsahamnida.*](https://youtu.be/w7Cm5Vd8pGM?t=10)

I truly enjoyed answering them, but I need to run now. Stay vigilant and continue to seek evidenced-based advice. 

Hi Reddit, I'm Nsikan Akpan, a science editor at National Geographic covering the COVID-19 outbreak. I hold a Ph.D. in pathobiology (a field devoted to studying the basic mechanisms of disease) from Columbia University, where I studied neurological disorders. My academic history also involves research on infectious disease, and at one point, I worked as a science writer for a virologist who consulted on the movie Contagion. Ask me anything about how a major news outlet handles an outbreak like coronavirus, but in a science-focused way.

f4sxfl,CV is no joke...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4sxfl/cv_is_no_joke/,"My aunt and uncle were Americans on the Princess Cruise ship in Japan. They are obsessively healthy people in their 60s and early 70s. They are now both in the ICU in the hospital in Japan. My uncle is having a hard time breathing and my aunt is a week behind him with all her symptoms. This virus is no joke. These are people who go hiking and walking for miles everyday. They had zero health problems. They looked younger than their age. Now they are fighting for their life. If they are both ok and make it through I can’t imagine the level of PTSD from this.

UPDATE:

NO THEY ARE NOT ASIAN AND NO THEY DONT SMOKE. This thing is the real deal. 

People think I’m lying. Why in hell would anyone lie about this?! Here they are on the local news: 


https://ktla.com/2020/02/12/tarzana-man-on-cruise-ship-quarantined-in-japan-hospitalized-for-coronavirus-symptoms-wife-says/

Here’s an old pic of us at a wedding as proof this is my family: 


https://imgur.com/gallery/2BKMFDL


UPDATE: My uncle is doing better. His fever finally broke. His lungs are pretty scarred from the CT (a reminder this was like a battle for his body). They are on the No Fly list until they clear 4 tests which are unavailable now. So they are prisoners in their hospital room in Japan until something happens. 

Now I’m worried about their mental health as well as my worry of the virus coming to our towns here.",2875,2875,0,/r/Coronavirus/comments/f4sxfl/cv_is_no_joke/,2020-02-16 19:27:17,514,[]
